This article is published through arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.02812. In general, among the difficult problems for VC approaches, the need for aligned data and over-smoothing of signals are two examples that have been carefully studied. Due to the difficulties in obtaining aligned objects, approaches using generative models such as variable autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) were studied, as they can be trained with non-parallel data. Some previous work successfully used VAE for VC, but produced the audio frame by frame. Some other previous works were able to separate linguistic content from speaker characteristics when learning representations, but based on some heuristic assumptions they investigated.
