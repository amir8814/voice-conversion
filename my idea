Innovation: We propose an autoencoder architecture based on elliptic cryptography that is able to deal with multiple frames at the same time, which leads to better results, because in this way the information carried by neighboring frames can be taken into account. This approach also uses a co-trained speaker classifier to eliminate the need for prior heuristic assumptions. This approach is able to train several single models to transform the speaker's voice to many different speakers, with parallel data, by separating the speaker features from the linguistic content.
